With over five years of experience, I specialize in designing, optimizing, and maintaining data pipelines that keep businesses running smoothly.\nBut what exactly is a Data Engineer? # Data Engineers ‚Äî are data pipeline architects, SQL wizards, JSON therapists, API whisperers and guardians of the galaxy clean data.\nWe build and maintain the invisible highways that transport data from point A to point B, ensuring that analysts and data scientists don‚Äôt have to scrape insights off the floor.\nWe spend our days wrangling rogue datasets, untangling code spaghetti, and explaining (for the hundredth time) why ‚Äújust throwing it in Excel‚Äù is (usually) not a scalable solution.\nThink of us as the backstage crew of the data world ‚Äî if everything works perfectly, nobody notices; if something breaks, suddenly everyone loses their minds cares.\nWhether it‚Äôs orchestrating complex ETL workflows, fine-tuning distributed computing jobs, or untangling a particularly stubborn SQL query, I enjoy solving problems that make data more accessible and useful.\nI‚Äôm always eager to learn and explore new technologies that help me grow as a data engineer.\nüìú Certifications \u0026amp; Accreditations # I am continuously working on expanding my tech toolkit and certifications are a way of patting myself on the back and validating my knowledge.\nüìú Languages # English | C2 Proficiency - Issued by University of Cambridge (Nov 2017) Data Engineering aside, in my free time, I am\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;usually somewhere between learning and tinkering. When I am not spending time with my wife and cats, I probably am:\nexperimenting with game development, learning Godot and Unity trying to create assets for my games creating pixel art or 3D models playing around with music production or just jamming to my favorite metal tunes on one of my electric guitars or just playing video games (because of my recently developed affinity for making games, I call this market research) Sometime in the future (near or far) I hope to start writing blog posts about game development (my journey), or maybe even create YouTube Developer Diaries.\nWant to connect?
