### 🔧 But what exactly is a _Data Engineer_?

**Data Engineer** (/ˈdeɪtə ˈɛnʤɪnɪr/ or /ˈdætə ˈɛnʤɪnɪr/, depending on how fancy you feel) — a data pipeline architect, SQL wizard, JSON therapist, API whisperer and guardian of ~~the galaxy~~ clean data.

Data Engineers **build and maintain the invisible highways that transport data from point A to point B**, ensuring that analysts and data scientists don’t have to scrape insights off the floor. 

We spend our days **wrangling rogue datasets, untangling code spaghetti**, and explaining (for the hundredth time) why **“just throwing it in Excel”** is *not* a scalable solution.

Think of us as the **backstage crew of the data world** — if everything works perfectly, nobody notices; if something breaks, *suddenly* everyone cares.

Whether it’s orchestrating complex ETL workflows, fine-tuning distributed computing jobs, or untangling a particularly stubborn SQL query, I enjoy solving problems that make data more accessible and useful.

I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies that help me grow as a data engineer.
