### But what exactly is a _Data Engineer_?

**Data Engineers**  ‚Äî are data pipeline architects, SQL wizards, JSON therapists, API whisperers and guardians of ~~the galaxy~~ clean data.

We **build and maintain the invisible highways that transport data from point A to point B**, ensuring that analysts and data scientists don‚Äôt have to scrape insights off the floor. 

We spend our days **wrangling rogue datasets, untangling code spaghetti**, and explaining (for the hundredth time) why **‚Äújust throwing it in Excel‚Äù** is (usually) *not* a scalable solution.

Think of us as the **backstage crew of the data world** ‚Äî if everything works perfectly, nobody notices; if something breaks, *suddenly* everyone ~~loses their minds~~ cares.

Whether it‚Äôs orchestrating complex ETL workflows, fine-tuning distributed computing jobs, or untangling a particularly stubborn SQL query, I enjoy solving problems that make data more accessible and useful.

I‚Äôm always eager to learn and explore new technologies that help me grow as a data engineer.

*I am continuously working on expanding my tech toolkit and certifications are a way of patting myself on the back and validating my knowledge.*

### Data Engineering aside, in my free time, I am...

...usually somewhere between learning and tinkering. When I am not spending time with my wife and cats, I probably am:

- experimenting with game development, learning Godot and Unity
- trying to create assets for my games creating pixel art or 3D models
- playing around with music production or just jamming to my favorite metal tunes on one of my electric guitars
- or just playing video games (because of my recently developed affinity for making games, I call this `market research`)

Sometime in the future (near or far) I hope to start writing blog posts about game development (my journey), or maybe even create YouTube Developer Diaries.
